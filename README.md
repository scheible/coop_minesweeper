# coop_minesweeper
A multiplayer coop version of the well known minesweeper game. Made with Python and PyQt5.

# IDE
I used pyCharm to develop the project. However it is just a bunch of python files, so I think it is easy to manage

# PyQt
You need to install PyQt5 (preferably in an virtual environment) in order to execute the project
